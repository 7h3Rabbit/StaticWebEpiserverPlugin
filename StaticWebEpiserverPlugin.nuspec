    <releaseNotes>
## BREAKING CHANGE ##
Resource naming has been changed, set "StaticWeb:UseResourceUrl" to true and "StaticWeb:UseContentHash" to false to get old behavior.

New features:
- Added support for using static pages inside your EpiServer installation

- Added support for content-type: x-javascript
- Added support for WebResource.axd and ScriptResource.axd
- Added Visitor Group support, new criteria called "StaticWeb user" under "Technical" category
- Now possible to specify sub folder for resources
- Possible to disable StaticWebEpiServerPlugin from web.config
- Default resource name is now a content hash
- Possible to use old resource naming (by only use resource url for naming)
- Possible to use both resource url and content hash for resource naming
- Using new configuration element in web.config for settings
- Add current number of pages generated ( in scheduled job )
- Added support for resources from href attribute on a-element
- Add ability to change supported file extensions and content types from default

Bug fixes:
- We now support both ' and " for resource finding
- Resources in CSS files are now added to references resources
- IStaticWebIgnoreGenerate and IStaticWebIgnoreGenerateDynamically are now supported in scheduled job also
- Scheduled job is not sending current referenced resources list to events (New property: CurrentResources)
- Scheduled job "Generate StaticWeb" changes place in menu everytime

Additional:
- Added extension StaticWebEpiserverPlugin.RequiredCssOnly to allow for extraction of required CSS Only (for example to use as inline on every page)
